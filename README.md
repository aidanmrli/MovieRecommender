# MovieRecommender
Movie Recommender system using LightGCN model proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02126. Inspired by Stanford CS224W.

Presented to a team in my data science internship in Summer 2022 to share with them what I learned about graph neural network pipelines and teach them
about the basics of graph neural networks.

Uses Python, PyTorch, PyTorch-Geometric, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn.
